What is egg hunter? and why on earth would you need it? This post will answer these questions and discuss [access()](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/access.2.html) syscall, which will be a vital part of our shellcode. The post will then conclude by demoing a working egg hunter shellcode. Please note all of the work here is based off of [Skapeâ€™s paper](http://www.hick.org/code/skape/papers/egghunt-shellcode.pdf).
