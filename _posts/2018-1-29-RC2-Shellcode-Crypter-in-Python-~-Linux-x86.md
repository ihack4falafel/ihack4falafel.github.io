Introduction
------------
RC2 is a symmetric-key block cipher which was popular in the first half of the 90s of the last century. RC2 also known as ARC2 was designed by Ron Rivest of RSA Security in 1987. Without going into too much details, RC2 consist of block size and key length amongst others things (more on that later). In this blog post, we’ll create RC2 shellcode crypter/decrpter to demonstrate the concept. Please note that I’m no RC2 expert and this blog post is by no means an overview of RC2 algorithm.
