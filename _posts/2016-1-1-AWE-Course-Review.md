Introduction
------------
This writeup is aimed at folks who're ~~contemplating~~ preparing to take on the AWE course offered by OffSec at Black Hat and not quite sure where to start. Although you may be thinking taking the course was just the natural continuation of OSCP and OSCE however, in my case the real reasoning behind my decicion is the fact the couse is all about Windows exploitation which is what I personally want to excel at, not that I dislike Linux, it's just I'm not interested in it from an exploitation standpoint. I also want to point out that I'm more interested in logic bugs than memory corruption but the content apply to both cases really.

Registeration
