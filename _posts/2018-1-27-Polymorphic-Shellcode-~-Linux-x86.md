Polymorphism is a technique used to mutate code in a way that will keep the original functionality intact. For example, `1+1` and `4-2` both achieve the same result while using different values and operations. Polymorphic shellcode can aid in efforts to evade Anti-virus and IDS/IPS. This post will look at few shellcodes and how to produce polymorphic version of them.
